# Form Building

**Author**: Jimmy Chang
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We set up an html page that allows for the user to submit a new article for the blog.

## Getting Started
In order to get it working; you need to write a form into the HTML, create a template for the preview of the new article, create an event handler for when the form is written into, create separate functions so only certain functions run on page load, use JSON to stringify the new template of the article so that it could be copy-pasted into the blogArticles.js.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars.js

## Change Log
03-16-2018 5:50pm - Both pages load and new articles form creates a preview and something you can copy-paste into the blogArticles.js for a new article.
